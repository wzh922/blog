**第二部分：科研竞赛**

&emsp;&emsp;在科研竞赛方面，我独立思考、精益求精，积极参与各类项目和竞赛。
&emsp;&emsp;在今年，我参与了基于深度学习的无人陆空物流系统项目。主要负责训练YOLO目标检测和语义分割模型，同时也包括数据集的查找与标注，实现对车、人、动物、无人机和鸟类等障碍物进行检测，并引用开源项目YOLOP实现对车道和车道线的分割。同时，还集成了DeepFace进行活体检测，并负责实现内网穿透功能，让远端可以访问电脑端口。
&emsp;&emsp;2024年，我还参与了基于ROS和YOLO的智慧社区系统项目。主要负责训练YOLO目标检测模型检测红绿灯、人群及火灾等，实现小车的SLAM建图和定点导航功能，集成Paddle OCR进行文字识别，并调用百度的TTS API实现信息实时播报。此外，我还担任了数据集的采集与标注工作。
&emsp;&emsp;在竞赛方面，我荣获了3项国家级竞赛奖项，包括2024全球校园人工智能算法精英大赛国家级一等奖、2024睿抗机器人开发者大赛智能侦察赛项国家级二等奖、2024中国软件杯软件设计大赛飞桨小汪赛道国家级三等奖。此外，我还获得包括数学建模、计算机设计大赛和蓝桥杯等9项省级竞赛奖项。

&emsp;&emsp;**In terms of research and competitions, I think independently and strive for excellence, actively participating in various projects and competitions.**
&emsp;&emsp;**This year, I participated in a deep learning-based unmanned land-air logistics system project, mainly responsible for training YOLO object detection and semantic segmentation models, as well as dataset searching and annotation, achieving detection of vehicles, people, animals, drones, and birds. I also used the open-source YOLOP project for lane and lane line segmentation, integrated DeepFace for liveness detection, and implemented intranet penetration for remote access to computer ports.**
&emsp;&emsp;**In 2024, I also participated in a smart community system project based on ROS and YOLO, mainly responsible for training YOLO models to detect traffic lights, crowds, and fires, implementing SLAM mapping and fixed-point navigation for small vehicles, integrating Paddle OCR for text recognition, and using Baidu's TTS API for real-time information broadcasting. I was also responsible for data collection and annotation.**

I have also won five honorary titles, including Heilongjiang Province Outstanding Student and School Advanced Individual in Volunteer Service.**

**第四部分：未来规划**

&emsp;&emsp;对于未来，我志存高远、逐梦远航。
&emsp;&emsp;大四期间，我计划踏实完成本科阶段学业，保持阅读文献的习惯；课程结束之后前往企业实习，提高动手和实践能力，最重要的是提高团队合作能力；然后认真完成毕业论文，提高科研能力。
&emsp;&emsp;研究生阶段，我也有明确的规划。研一，我将致力于巩固人工智能领域的基础知识，密切关注人工智能领域的前沿动态，广泛涉猎导师的研究领域，不断拓展视野，提升科研能力。研二、研三，我将跟随导师深入开展课题研究，全身心投入到科研项目中，注重理论与实践相结合，借助新前沿科技进展，争取发表优质论文、取得高质量的学术成果。

&emsp;&emsp;**For the future, I have high aspirations and pursue my dreams.**
&emsp;&emsp;**During my senior year, I plan to complete my undergraduate studies steadily, maintain the habit of reading literature; after the courses, I will intern in enterprises to improve my practical skills, especially teamwork; then I will complete my graduation thesis seriously to enhance my research ability.**
&emsp;&emsp;**In the postgraduate stage, I also have clear plans. In the first year, I will focus on consolidating the basics of AI, keeping up with the latest trends, exploring my supervisor's research fields, broadening my horizons, and improving my research ability. In the second and third years, I will follow my supervisor to conduct in-depth research, devote myself to projects, combine theory with practice, leverage cutting-edge technology, and strive to publish high-quality papers and achieve excellent academic results.**
